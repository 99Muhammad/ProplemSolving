# Leap Year Checker

This is a C++ console application that determines if a given year is a leap year. Leap years are significant in the Gregorian calendar as they contain an extra day in February, and this application allows users to verify if a specific year meets the criteria for being a leap year.

## Features

- Prompts the user to input a year.
- Determines if the input year is a leap year based on the rules:
  - A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 400.
  - A year is also a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100.
- Outputs whether the entered year is a "Leap Year" or "Not a Leap Year."

## Example

**Input:** 2024  
**Output:** "Leap Year"
